# css-properties
Properties of CSS code

Write a function css_properties(css) that takes as a parameter a single string containing CSS code, and returns all the properties found in it. The properties should be returned as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the key and the value of the property. Note that the tuples should be in the same order as their respective properties are found in the code.
